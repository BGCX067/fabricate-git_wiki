#summary How to get help on fabricate details

As with any python program, you can get help right from within python:
{{{
 python
 import fabricate
 help(fabricate)
 help(fabricate.<specific_function>)
}}}

This will show some very detailed help, but you'll notice near the top a list of exported functions that you can get help on.  This list includes all exported functions, but with the most essential ones first: setup, run, main, autoclean, fabricate_version, etc.

Alternatively, if you import fabricate the recommended way for build scripts, you can get help on specific functions like this:
{{{
 python
 from fabricate import *
 help(<function>)
}}}

If this doesn't get you anywhere, search for the specific function you want inside the source.  It's simple source and the chances are that even if you don't know python, you'll be able to figure out basically what you need to know.
