#summary Benchmarks of how fast fabricate is

These benchmarks were run using the benchmark.py script in the source tree. This script creates a bunch of C source and header files, and then when you tell it to build, it creates a fabricate build.py script which it runs using the given runner.

Tested on a Windows XP 32-bit system, compiles done with tcc (Tiny C Compiler). Times below are normalized so AlwaysRunner is 1.0:

|| Runner || time (normalized) ||
|| !AlwaysRunner || 1.0 ||
|| !AtimesRunner first build || 1.1 ||
|| !AtimesRunner subsequent builds || 0.043 ||
